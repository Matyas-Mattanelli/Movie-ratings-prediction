## Predicting movie ratings

The current project contains the implementation of a movie prediction model. The main method used is the linear regression. In addition, in an attempt to improve the prediction capabilities, a language model is estimated based on the movie previews. The results are available in a presentation in [DM%20project.pdf](DM%20project.pdf)
